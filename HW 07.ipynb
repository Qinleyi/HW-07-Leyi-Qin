    "###### Summary\n",
    "In this session, we discussed the apparent contradiction in a statistical model where:\n",
    "* The R-squared value is low (17.6%), indicating that the model only explains a small portion of the variability in the data.\n",
    "* Despite this, many coefficients are large and show strong evidence against the null hypothesis of \"no effect,\" meaning the predictors are statistically significant.\n",
    "We clarified that these two aspects are not necessarily contradictory. A model can have statistically significant coefficients, meaning the predictors have an effect on the outcome, but still have a low R-squared value if it fails to capture all the important factors influencing the dependent variable. This situation can arise from issues like model simplicity (missing relevant variables), multicollinearity, or a focus on individual significance rather than overall explanatory power.\n",

    "In this session, we discussed the development of a series of linear regression models built to predict the HP of Pokémon, using a variety of predictor variables from the dataset:\n",
    "Model 3: Started with a simple model using Attack and Defense to predict HP.\n",
    "Model 4: Expanded by adding more predictors and interactions, including Speed, Legendary, and other factors like Sp. Def and Sp. Atk.\n",
    "Model 5: Further extended by incorporating categorical variables like Generation, Type 1, and Type 2, allowing the model to account for different categories in the dataset.\n",
    "Model 6: Refined the model by introducing specific binary indicator variables, such as whether the Pokémon is of a certain type or generation, based on previous model results.\n",
    "Model 7: Further enhanced by adding interaction terms between continuous variables like Attack, Speed, Sp. Def, and Sp. Atk, while keeping the binary indicators to capture more complex relationships.\n",
    "Each model evolved by adding more variables, focusing on significant predictors, and increasing the complexity to improve predictive power and model fit. This process allowed for a more nuanced understanding of how various factors affect the dependent variable (HP).\n",

    "The analysis compares Model6 and Model7 by testing them on in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values. Model7 is more complex, fitting the training data well but showing poorer generalizability when predicting future generations, indicating overfitting. In contrast, Model6 is simpler and performs better at generalizing to unseen data, despite a slightly lower in-sample R-squared. This demonstrates that simpler models like Model6 often provide better generalizability and interpretability, making them preferable, especially when predicting future data."

    "###### Summary\n",
    "In this session, we analyzed how well different models (model6 and model7) trained on Pokémon data from specific generations can predict HP both within and across generations. Here’s the process we discussed:\n",
    "Original Models: We first evaluated model6 and model7 on the full dataset, calculating in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values as a baseline.\n",
    "Generation-Specific Models:\n",
    "Gen 1 Model: We trained each model on Generation 1 data and tested its predictive accuracy on Pokémon from other generations. This setup tested whether a model trained on early-generation Pokémon could generalize to other generations.\n",
    "Gen 1 to 5 Model: We then trained each model on Generations 1 through 5 and tested on Generation 6, assessing if patterns learned from the first five generations would apply to the sixth.\n",
    "Key Metrics:\n",
    "In-Sample R-squared: Measures how well each model fits the data it was trained on.\n",
    "Out-of-Sample R-squared: Indicates the model's generalizability across generations, revealing if patterns learned from one set of Pokémon data apply to other generations.\n",
    "The analysis shows each model’s ability to generalize, highlighting how well training on certain generations predicts HP for others, and helping to understand each model’s robustness.\n",
